### Building


Make sure the following **requirements** are installed in your system:

* [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) 2.0 or higher
* [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) if you're on Linux or macOS.

```
> build.cmd // on windows
$ ./build.sh  // on unix
```

#### Environment Variables

* `CONFIGURATION` will set the [configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build?tabs=netcore2x#options) of the dotnet commands.  If not set it will default to Release.

`CONFIGURATION=Debug ./build.sh` will result in things like `dotnet build -c Debug`


### Watch Tests

The `WatchTests` target will use [dotnet-watch](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/blob/master/aspnetcore/tutorials/dotnet-watch.md) to watch for changes in your lib or tests and re-run your tests on all `TargetFrameworks`

```
./build.sh WatchTests
```

### Releasing
* [Start a git repo with a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)

```
git add .
git commit -m "Scaffold"
git remote add origin origin https://github.com/user/MyCoolNewLib.git
git push -u origin master
```

* [Add your nuget API key to paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/paket-config.html#Adding-a-NuGet-API-key)

```
paket config add-token "https://www.nuget.org" 4003d786-cc37-4004-bfdf-c4f3e8ef9b3a
```


* Then update the `RELEASE_NOTES.md` with a new version, date, and release notes [ReleaseNotesHelper](https://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/apidocs/fake-releasenoteshelper.html)

```
#### 0.2.0 - 2017-04-20
* FEATURE: Does cool stuff!
* BUGFIX: Fixes that silly oversight
```

* You can then use the `Release` target.  This will:
    * make a commit bumping the version:  `Bump version to 0.2.0` and add the release notes to the commit
    * publish the package to nuget
    * push a git tag

```
./build.sh Release
```
